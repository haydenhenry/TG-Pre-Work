var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
const carbonara = `You can make carbonara with ${pasta}, ${meat}, and a sauce made with ${sauce}.`;


// It is important to note that the ES6 is the updated version of JavaScript, but not all web browsers support all of the new features.
// caniuse.com is a website that provides data on web compatibility for HTML, CSS and JavaScript features.
// Babel is a Javascript library the lets you convert new Javascript into an older version.
