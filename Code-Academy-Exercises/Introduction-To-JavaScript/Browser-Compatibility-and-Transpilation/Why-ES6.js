var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = 'You can make carbonara with' + pasta + ', ' + meat + ', and a sauce made with' + sauce + '.';


// ES6 introduced some key features, including a broader similarity to other programming languages, better readability, and bug fixes.
// ES6 is also backwards compatible with ES5, to help with browser compatibility issues.
