var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

const meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

let sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6

// The first step in installing babel is to set up the node package manager, which allows developers
// to manage node packages. These packages are directories to code written and shared by other
// developers and can be used to reduce work and avoid bugs. First, we have to run npm init, which
// creates a package.json file in the root directory and contains info about the project like
// metadata, a list of node packages needed, and key-value pairs for command line scripts.
