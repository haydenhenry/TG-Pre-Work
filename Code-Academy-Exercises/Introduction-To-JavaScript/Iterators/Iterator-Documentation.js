const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some(word => {
  return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array
const interestingWords = words.filter((word) => {return word.length > 5});


// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

console.log(interestingWords.every((word) => {return word.length > 5}));


//In this lesson I learned how to use the MDN docs to research iterator methods and find errors in code.
