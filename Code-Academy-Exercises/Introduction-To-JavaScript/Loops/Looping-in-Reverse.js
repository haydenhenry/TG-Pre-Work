// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){

// We can set a loop to run backwards by setting the iterater variable to the highest desired number and setting the stopping condition
// to less than the desired amount. The iterater should decrease every loop.
