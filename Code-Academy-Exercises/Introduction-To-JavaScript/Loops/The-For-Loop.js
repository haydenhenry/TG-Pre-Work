// A for loop is a loop that typically contains an iterator variable, which is initialized,
// checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value each iteration.
// The initialization starts the loop, the stopping condition checks the variable and if true stops the code.
// The iteration statement updates the variable every loop, getting it closer to the stopping condition.
