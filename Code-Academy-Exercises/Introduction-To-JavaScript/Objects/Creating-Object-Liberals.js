// An object literal is an object that has been assigned to a variable using curly braces. We can fill the object with
// unordered data that is organized into key-value pairs, the key being the identifier that points to the value.
// A key value pair is made by creating an identifier followed by a colon, which is then followed by the value.
// Each key-value pair in an object literal is separated by a comma. A key string that does not have any special character can omit the quotations.
