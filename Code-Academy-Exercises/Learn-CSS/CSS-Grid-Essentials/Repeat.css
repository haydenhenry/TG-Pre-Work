/* In this lesson, I learned that the repeat function was created specifically for use in CSS Grid. It allows you to write a function
that makes duplicate columns and rows based on your specifications. It starts with repeat(x, y) where x is how many times you
want to repeat the function, and y being the dimensions for the column or row.  */
