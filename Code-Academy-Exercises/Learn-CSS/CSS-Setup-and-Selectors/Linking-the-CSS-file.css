/* In this lesson I learned how to link the CSS file to the HTML file using the link tag.
Several attributes are used:
href- the hyper reference using the file name that is being linked to
type - the type of file being linked, which helps the browser
rel - describes the relationship of the linked file, in this case the stylesheet */
