<!-- In this lesson I learned about HTML comments and how they can prove very useful. They can be used
to add description to code, so that it is easier understood on a later viewing or for a new developer. They can
also be used for experimentation with code, thanks to the fact that HTML comments are ignored by the browser. -->
