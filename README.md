## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

When we navigate to a website such as https://www.tectonicgroup.com/, we are using a uniform resourse locator to tell the computer where to find the file we need, and how to read it. Then we, the client, ask a computer, the server, to fetch the web document. The server then searches for the document, and when it is found it delivers it to you. The file is not saved to your computer, but displayed temporarily, and if you need the file again, this process must be repeated.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

To begin, the data is broken into small chunks called packets, which are more efficient to send. It is sent to your computer and reassembled as information that is interpreted by your browser and displayed as web page or video.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the main front end programming languages that are displayed on the client side in the browser. HTML covers the structure of a web page, while CSS handles the layout and presentation of a page. JavaScript handles the interactivity of a web page.

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

A server is a dedicated computer whose main function is to deliver content to the client. Server-side code's main role is to control the information that is sent to a client.

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

A client is a program that retrieves information from the server, and presents it to the user. Client-side code's main role is to structure the presentation of data that a user gets.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

The client-side code is retrieved and rendered every time you go to a webpage, so if one instance is equal to the 1 page load, they are created once every time the page is opened.

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

The server side code will stay the same until it is updated by a developer. This means only one version of the server side code is available at any given time.

## What is runtime?

Runtime refers to the period of time when a program is running, starting when the program opens and ending when the program is closed.

## How many instances of the the databases connected to the server application are created?

If databases equate to a collection of data that is stored in a server, then there is only one finite source of data that can be drawn upon and given. I am not an expert on this however, and there may be cases of data that can be created within a server.
